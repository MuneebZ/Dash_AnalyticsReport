<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

To launch the Dash application, type `python app.py` in the integrated terminal. The Flask development server searches for `app.py` by default. When running, the following output should be displayed:

```sh
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

 * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
 * Environment: production
   WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
   Use a production WSGI server instead.
 * Debug mode: on

```

Once running, navigate to the url link provided in the terminal, which is `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` (or `http://localhost:8050/`). 

Dash runs on port 8050 by default, so the address will be `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` when you run your Dash application in your browser.

You are greeted with three plots related to the task. The first plot has "Wandsworth" by default, while the other two plots are empty, encouraging the user to explore all of the available options. All plots are organised in descending order. The date range varies between the three plots.

You will see the resultant data to your query after selecting another local authority from the dropdown menu.
